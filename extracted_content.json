    "1.3. Background": "",
    "1.3.1. PI3K/mTOR": "PI3Ks constitute a lipid kinase family involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes,\nincluding proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal organization, and glucose transport.1 PI3K\nenzymes catalyze the formationof the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4,\n5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates many target proteins, most notably\nphosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1(PDK1). The downstream targets of these protein\nkinases, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BCL2-associated agonist of cell\ndeath (BAD) and forkhead box O proteins (FOXOs), mediate most of the proliferation,\ngrowth and survival signaling from PI3Ks (Figure 3).2,3 Activation of the PI3K pathway has\nbeen implicated in a wide variety of human cancers. Mutations in\nphosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), the gene\nencoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, are very common in human cancers, having been\nobserved in prostate, and colorectal tumors, among others. Phosphatase and tensin homolog\n(PTEN) deletion, leading to activation of Akt has been observed in many types of\nmalignancies including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma.4\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 36\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",

PF-05212384\ndoses ranging from 10mg to 319mgweekly were administered to a total of 77patients using\na continuous reassessment method (CRM) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nThe MTD was decared to be 154mg, a dose level at which patients received a median\nnumber of 7weekly doses (range 1-24). In general treatment with single agent PF-05212384\nwas well toleratedover multiple cycles of treatment. Table2includes the number of dose\nlimiting toxicities (DLTs)that occurred during the active treatment phase with PF-05212384.\nMost DLTs occurred at dose levels above the MTD.\nTreatment-related adverse events are summarized in Table3and Table4.

    "1.3.4. Docetaxel": "Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane whose mechanism of action is to promote tubulin\nassembly in microtubules and to inhibit their depolymerizationwhich causes cells to arrest in\nmitosis and eventually undergo apoptosis. Docetaxel is effective in a wide variety of solid\ntumors and is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic\nagents for the treatment of patients with breast, lung, hormone-refractory prostate, gastric,\nand head and neck tumors. Docetaxel doses range from 60-100mg/m2 depending on the\nindication and are administered as an infusion every three weeks. Notable toxicities include\nfluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions.15 Premedication is required to minimize these\nadverse event and typically consists of dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day (bid) given for\n3days starting 1day prior to docetaxel administration. Docetaxel is most commonly\nassociated with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse events.\nIn vitrodrug interaction studies revealed that docetaxelis metabolized by the CYP3A4\nisoenzymeand its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of\ncompounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Docetaxel is\nprimarily eliminated by fecal excretion.\nComplete information for docetaxel may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the\nEuropean Union (EU) European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved Summary of Product\nCharacteristics (SmPC) forTaxotere\u00ae.",
    "1.3.5. Cisplatin": "Cisplatin reacts in vivo by binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA, ultimately triggering\napoptosis. It is used widely as a single agent or in combination with other agents to treat\nvarious types of cancer including testicular, bladder, small cell lung, ovarian, and TNBC.\nCisplatin doses range from 50-100mg/m2 administered IV every 3-4weeks. In order to\nmitigate nephrotoxic risks, pre-and post-dose hydration is often used as described in the\nproduct label.\nNotable toxicities include renal insufficiency, myelosuppresion, nausea and vomiting.\nDue to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to\nchemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to\nenzyme-catalyzed metabolism. Cisplatin is not metabolized hepatically. Cisplatin is\nexcreted through the urine.\nComplete information for cisplatinmay be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the\nUnited Kingdom (UK)approvedSummary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) from Hospira\nUK Ltd.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 42\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",
    "1.3.5.1. PF-05212384 Plus Cisplatin in Patients with TNBC": "The rationale for combining cisplatin with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or\nlocally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) is\ntwo-fold: First, there is amplified genomic instability of TNBC tumor cells, leading to an\nincreased vulnerability of TNBC to DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin. TNBC tumor\ncells harbor activating mutations in thePIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets\nfor inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384.46\nIn addition, somefraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair\ngenes breast cancer1 (BRCA1)and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit\nin the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. The inability to repair\nDNA efficiently makes these cells particularlysusceptible to the DNA cross-link strand\nbreaks caused by platinating agents, like cisplatin.40,46\nThe use of cisplatin in combination regimens in patients with TNBC has shown improved\nrates of tumor response in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting.40,50 As such, recent\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN)guidelines for treatment of metastatic\nTNBC have included platinum salts, such as cisplatin.51\nThe above information provides a sound rationale for combining PF-05212384 with cisplatin\nin the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC.",
    "1.3.6. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804)": "The investigational agent dacomitinib is an orally available, selective ATP-competitive\nirreversible small-molecule inhibitor of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER,\nerbB) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). This family ofRTKs includes the epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR, HER-1), HER-2 receptor (erbB2), and HER-4 (erbB4)\nreceptor and their oncogenic variants (ie,EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R point\nmutation, and EGFR T790M mutation). Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of\nthe HER family through binding at the adenose triphosphate (ATP) binding site, which\nresults in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. HER-1 and -2\nreceptor mutations and amplification have been investigated as possible favorable predictors\nof clinical efficacy and, in particular, it has been shown that patients with certain mutations\nof EGFR (exon 19deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) have significant benefit from\nEGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). Dacomitinib is being developed for patients\nwithpreviously treated,locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC).\nDacomitinib given orally without food in the FIH dose escalation study, A7471001, was\nabsorbed with a median time to themaximum observed concentration (T ) ranging from\nmax\n4to 24hours. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant effect of antacid administration\non C and AUC (defined as area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time\nmax inf\nzero to infinitytime) of dacomitinib. In general, the mean C and AUC of PF-00299894\nmax\nincreased with dose at the dose range evaluated.

    "1.3.7. Study Rationale": "Signaling through the PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor\nagents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with\nvarying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and DNA-damaging agents.22,23 In the\nclinic, activated PI3Kpathwayin tumors has been correlated with decreased response to\ntherapy and worse clinical outcomes.18,19\nIn addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling\naffecting sensitivity of cells to EGF receptor family signaling inhibitors. Specifically, the\nactivation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with\nHER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.24 In addition, pre-clinical\nstudies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM)and NSCLC cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse\nresistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models.20\nCollectively, these findings suggest thatPI3K/mTOR inhibitors may increase the efficacy of\nboth chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC)for the treatment\nof several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has shown clinical activity in several tumor\ntypes.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",

    "1.3.7.1.1. Docetaxel": "Docetaxel is a microtubule inhibitor which is active in a number of human solid tumors. In\npre-clinical invitrostudies, the combination of docetaxel and a PI3K inhibitor resulted in\nadditive and even synergistic activity in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Invivo\nexperiments revealed enhanced anti-tumorefficacy with the combination.16 Non-clinical\nexperiments in human NSCLC H1975 and H1650 xenograft models have demonstrated that\nthe combination of PF-05212384 and docetaxel is more effective than either drug alone\n(Figure4). Finally, patients with tumors with activated PI3K/Akt signaling have been shown\nto be less responsive to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including docetaxel and\npaclitaxel.17,18 The pre-clinical findings together with the clinical observations, suggest that\nthe addition of PF-05212384 to docetaxel may lead to enhanced antitumor effects in patients.\nFigure4.

Since\nsingle-agent cisplatin is active in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)the\ncombination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin may be an extremely effective regimen in an area\nof great medical need.24 Cisplatin is also used in combination with gemcitabine in a number\nof tumor types such as urothelial transitional cell cancers (TCC), NSCLC, and biliary tract\ntumors and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in ovarian cancer (OC).\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",

The MTD\nwas identified as 154mg QW. In study B1271002, PF-05212384 doses of 95, 110, and\n130mg/week were evaluated in combination with irinotecan 180mg/m2 every 2weeks; the\nMTD of PF-05212384 was 110mg/week when dosed in combination with irinotecan.\nIn the current trial, the PF-05212384 starting dose inall 3treatment arms will be 90mg/week\nwhich is 58% of the MTD for single agent PF-05212384 and slightly lower than the lowest\ndose evaluated in Phase 2 study B1271002 investigating PF-05212384 in combination with\nirinotecan. In the Phase 1 FIH trial (B2151001), PF-05212384 dose of 89mg/week (n=4)\nwas found to result in drug concentrations above the target concentration for approximately\n70hours.",
    "1.3.7.3. Rationale for Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Dacomitinib Starting Doses": "In Arm A, the starting dose of docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2 every 3weeks. This is the dose\nrecommended in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, in\ncombination with prednisone in hormone refractoryprostate cancer, and as single agent in\nNSCLC.28\nIn Arm B, the starting dose of cisplatin will be 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks which is the dose\noften used when it is administered as an every 3 week regimenin combination with\ndocetaxel,gemcitabine,or pemetrexed.29,30,31\nIn Arm C, the starting dose of dacomitinibwill be 30mg which is 67% of the MTD for\nsingle agent dacomitinib when administered orally once daily on a continuous dosing\nschedule. This starting dose was selected given the potential for overlapping toxicity with\nPF-05212384,such as mucositis and rash. In the dacomitinib FIH trial in patients with\nadvanced tumors, among 111patients treated in dose-escalation, 13 were treated at the\n30mg/day dose level. One DLT (mucositis) was observed in this group. The safety profile\nin the specific dose levels was not reported.32 As described in the IB, the 30mgdose has\nonly been evaluated in a small number patients in subsequent trialshowever the 30mgdose\nis generally better tolerated than the 45mg dose.\nDuring the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in\nindividual patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose (Section 5.2.5).",

In the\nfirst cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted inTable7. For any subsequent\ncohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total\nnumber of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level.\nFor example, if a cohort of 3patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of\nthem experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be\nto stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected\ndose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are\ntreated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number\nof patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1,\nthus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 56\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",

The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90\u2013310 mg/week in arm\n(B1\u2013B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).",

The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much\u201d and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.",

    "9.2. Statistical Methods and Properties": "",
    "9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B": "The MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090",
    "9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C": "For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17.
