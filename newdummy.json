In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen. Potential reasons for non-compliant dosing (ie, AEs, lost medication) will be\nfollowed up by the study site personnel and strategies to improve dosing compliance will be\nexplored.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 84\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

(12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit.

Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR.

Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer\nPfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the\nresults of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trial\nDatabase (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with\napplicable local laws/regulations.\nIn all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and\ncomplete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in\nwhich the study was conducted.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 122\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\nPfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.govfor Pfizer-sponsored\ninterventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer\nproduct regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.

    "1. INTRODUCTION": "1.1. Indication –Original Protocol through Amendment 4\nPF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents (docetaxel, cisplatin, and\ndacomitinib)is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR)inhibitor being developed for use in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.\n1.2. Indication –Amendment 5\nPF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin is being developed for use in adult womanwith\nmetastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer\n(TNBC) in first-through third-lines of therapy.\n1.3. Background\n1.3.1. PI3K/mTOR\nPI3Ks constitute a lipid kinase family involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes,\nincluding proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal organization, and glucose transport.1 PI3K\nenzymes catalyze the formationof the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4,\n5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates many target proteins, most notably\nphosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1(PDK1). The downstream targets of these protein\nkinases, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BCL2-associated agonist of cell\ndeath (BAD) and forkhead box O proteins (FOXOs), mediate most of the proliferation,\ngrowth and survival signaling from PI3Ks (Figure 3).2,3 Activation of the PI3K pathway has\nbeen implicated in a wide variety of human cancers. Mutations in\nphosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), the gene\nencoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, are very common in human cancers, having been\nobserved in prostate, and colorectal tumors, among others. Phosphatase and tensin homolog\n(PTEN) deletion, leading to activation of Akt has been observed in many types of\nmalignancies including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma.4\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 36\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has\nbeen described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying\nmechanisms of action including taxanesand deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA)-damaging\nagents.15,16 In the clinic, activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased\nresponse to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.17,18,19 In addition to resistance to cytotoxic\nagents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to EGF signaling\ninhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse\noutcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.18\nFinally, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation\nin glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have\ndemonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor\nmodels.20\n1.3.2. PF-05212384\nPF-05212384 is an ATP-competitive, pan class I PI3K inhibitor, with an IC of 0.4nM\n50\nagainst PI3Kαand against mTOR with antiproliferative activity in culture and anti-tumor\nactivity in xenograft models. It is intended to be dosed once weekly by intravenous (IV)\ninfusion.\n1.3.2.1. Preclinical Data for PF-05212384\nPF-05212384 has been shown to cause tumor growth inhibition as well as tumor regressions\nin a variety of human xenograft tumor models (Table1). In vivo biomarker studies\ndemonstratedthat PF-05212384 suppressed PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling as evidenced by\ndecreasedphosphorylation of AKT. These studies were done in MDA361 (human breast)\ntumor xenografts propagated in nude mice. In this model, pAKT at position T308 was\nsuppressed for 8hours with PF-05212384 at a dose of 25mg/kg. Additionally, increased\ncleavedpoly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a markerfor apoptosis, was observed which\ncorrelated with the tumor regression.\nTable1.

PF-05212384 Clinical Experience\nPF-05212384 has been evaluated in one completed Phase1 clinical trial in adult patients with\nsolid cancer, and is being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials(one Phase1b study in\ncombination with irinotecan, and one Phase2 study in endometrial cancer as single agent).\n1.3.3.1. Phase 1 Study of PF-05212384 Single Agent in Patients with Advanced Solid\nTumors (B2151001)\nThe first-in-human (FIH) Phase1 trial, B2151001 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics\n(PK) of single agent PF-05212384 in patients with advanced solid tumors. PF-05212384\ndoses ranging from 10mg to 319mgweekly were administered to a total of 77patients using\na continuous reassessment method (CRM) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nThe MTD was decared to be 154mg, a dose level at which patients received a median\nnumber of 7weekly doses (range 1-24). In general treatment with single agent PF-05212384\nwas well toleratedover multiple cycles of treatment. Table2includes the number of dose\nlimiting toxicities (DLTs)that occurred during the active treatment phase with PF-05212384.\nMost DLTs occurred at dose levels above the MTD.\nTreatment-related adverse events are summarized in Table3and Table4. Themost common\ntreatment-related AEs at the MTD(154mg)were mucosal inflammationand nausea,which\nwere reported in nearlyhalf of thepatients (42.9% and 40.5%,respectively), followed by\nhyperglycemia (26.2%), vomiting (23.8%), and asthenia, decreased appetite, and fatigue\n(21.4%each). Dysgeusia (19.0%), AST increase, and diarrhea (14.3% each) were also\nfrequent adverse eventsassociated with treatment with PF-05212384. To be noted, although\nhyperglycemia was reported as an AE in 26.2% of patients at the MTD, the chemistry data\nshowed hyperglycemia in 78.6% of patients treated at the MTD of PF-05212384, although\nmainly of Grades 1 and 2 (71.4% of all patients treated at the MTD); 3 (7.1%) patients had\nGrade3 hyperglycemia.\nThree patients discontinued treatment with PF-05212384 due to treatment related adverse\nevents (one patient with increased ALT at the 319 mg dose level, and two patients with\nmucositis at the 222mg and 319mg dose levels, respectively).\nTable2.

While the data appearedto\nindicatethat the half life increasedwith dose, it is considered that this finding was likely to\nbean artifact of poor assay sensitivity at lower doses. The estimated half life is similar\nacross doses from 89 to 319mg weekly. Clearance of PF-05212384 is linear with dose, and\ndistribution is relatively high. Plasma concentrations of PF-05212384 exceededthe 50% of\nmaximal inhibition (IC50)of PI3K and mTOR dependent phosphorylation events for\napproximately 70hours at doses of 89 and 154mg, and for ≥120hours at the 266mg and\n319mg dose. The target concentration was based on projected human plasma concentration\nfrom xenograft models where analysis of xenograft tumor tissue showed a greater than 50%\nsuppression of pAKT and an induction of cleaved PARP, an indicator of cellular\ncommitment to apoptosis.\nTo date,partial responses (PR) havebeen observed in 2patients (NSCLC with liver and lung\nmetastases [n=1] and granularcellulartumor of the ovary with peritoneal and pleural\nmetastases [n=1]) and 19patients have experienced stable disease (SD), with 6 experiencing\nSD >6 months.\n1.3.3.2. Phase 1 Study of PF-05212384 in Combination with Irinotecan in Patients with\nAdvanced Solid Tumors (B1271002)\nA Phase1b study is ongoing which includes the assessment of escalating doses of\nPF-05212384 in combination with irinotecan (180 mg/m2)every 2weeks of 28-day cycles.\nTo-date, 13patients have been treated withPF-05212384 at doses of 95 mg/week (n=3),\n110mg/week (n=6), and 130mg/week (n=4). Two patients out of 4experienced\ndose-limiting toxicities,Grade4 febrile neutropenia (n=1) and Grade3 fatigue(n=1),while\nreceiving 130mg/week of P-05212384 plus irinotecan 180mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Based on\nthese findings, the MTD for PF-05212384 when combined with irinotecan 180mg/m2 every\n2weeks has been determined to be 110mg/week. The most common treatment-related AEs\nreported in the 6patients treated at the MTD include nausea in 3patients and alopecia,\ndiarrhea, proteinuria, maculopapular rash and vomiting in 2patients each. All of the events\nwere Grade1-2. One patient with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC),previously treated with\nirinotecan, was treated at the PF-05212384 95mg/week dose cohort and experienced a PR\n(of 6cycles in duration).

Four patients have achieved clinical benefit as defined by\nlack of disease progression in first 16weeks. The preliminary safety profile of PF-05212384\nfrom B1271004 is similar to that from Study B2151001.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 41\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nComplete information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Study\nDocument (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure.\n1.3.4. Docetaxel\nDocetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane whose mechanism of action is to promote tubulin\nassembly in microtubules and to inhibit their depolymerizationwhich causes cells to arrest in\nmitosis and eventually undergo apoptosis. Docetaxel is effective in a wide variety of solid\ntumors and is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic\nagents for the treatment of patients with breast, lung, hormone-refractory prostate, gastric,\nand head and neck tumors. Docetaxel doses range from 60-100mg/m2 depending on the\nindication and are administered as an infusion every three weeks. Notable toxicities include\nfluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions.15 Premedication is required to minimize these\nadverse event and typically consists of dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day (bid) given for\n3days starting 1day prior to docetaxel administration. Docetaxel is most commonly\nassociated with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse events.\nIn vitrodrug interaction studies revealed that docetaxelis metabolized by the CYP3A4\nisoenzymeand its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of\ncompounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Docetaxel is\nprimarily eliminated by fecal excretion.\nComplete information for docetaxel may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the\nEuropean Union (EU) European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved Summary of Product\nCharacteristics (SmPC) forTaxotere®.\n1.3.5. Cisplatin\nCisplatin reacts in vivo by binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA, ultimately triggering\napoptosis. It is used widely as a single agent or in combination with other agents to treat\nvarious types of cancer including testicular, bladder, small cell lung, ovarian, and TNBC.\nCisplatin doses range from 50-100mg/m2 administered IV every 3-4weeks. In order to\nmitigate nephrotoxic risks, pre-and post-dose hydration is often used as described in the\nproduct label.\nNotable toxicities include renal insufficiency, myelosuppresion, nausea and vomiting.\nDue to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to\nchemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to\nenzyme-catalyzed metabolism. Cisplatin is not metabolized hepatically. Cisplatin is\nexcreted through the urine.\nComplete information for cisplatinmay be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the\nUnited Kingdom (UK)approvedSummary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) from Hospira\nUK Ltd.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 42\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n1.3.5.1. PF-05212384 Plus Cisplatin in Patients with TNBC\nThe rationale for combining cisplatin with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or\nlocally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) is\ntwo-fold: First, there is amplified genomic instability of TNBC tumor cells, leading to an\nincreased vulnerability of TNBC to DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin. TNBC tumor\ncells harbor activating mutations in thePIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets\nfor inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384.46\nIn addition, somefraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair\ngenes breast cancer1 (BRCA1)and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit\nin the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. The inability to repair\nDNA efficiently makes these cells particularlysusceptible to the DNA cross-link strand\nbreaks caused by platinating agents, like cisplatin.40,46\nThe use of cisplatin in combination regimens in patients with TNBC has shown improved\nrates of tumor response in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting.40,50 As such, recent\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN)guidelines for treatment of metastatic\nTNBC have included platinum salts, such as cisplatin.51\nThe above information provides a sound rationale for combining PF-05212384 with cisplatin\nin the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC.\n1.3.6. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804)\nThe investigational agent dacomitinib is an orally available, selective ATP-competitive\nirreversible small-molecule inhibitor of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER,\nerbB) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). This family ofRTKs includes the epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR, HER-1), HER-2 receptor (erbB2), and HER-4 (erbB4)\nreceptor and their oncogenic variants (ie,EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R point\nmutation, and EGFR T790M mutation). Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of\nthe HER family through binding at the adenose triphosphate (ATP) binding site, which\nresults in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. HER-1 and -2\nreceptor mutations and amplification have been investigated as possible favorable predictors\nof clinical efficacy and, in particular, it has been shown that patients with certain mutations\nof EGFR (exon 19deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) have significant benefit from\nEGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). Dacomitinib is being developed for patients\nwithpreviously treated,locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC).\nDacomitinib given orally without food in the FIH dose escalation study, A7471001, was\nabsorbed with a median time to themaximum observed concentration (T ) ranging from\nmax\n4to 24hours. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant effect of antacid administration\non C and AUC (defined as area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time\nmax inf\nzero to infinitytime) of dacomitinib. In general, the mean C and AUC of PF-00299894\nmax\nincreased with dose at the dose range evaluated. After continuous once daily oral dose (QD)\nfor 14-days, the mean AUC accumulation of dacomitinib ranged from 4.39 to 6.18-fold,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 43\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nTable6provides a summary of the most common treatment-related AEs reported following\ntreatment with dacomitinib at 45mg QD in patients with advanced NSCLC.\nTable6.

Study Rationale\nSignaling through the PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor\nagents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with\nvarying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and DNA-damaging agents.22,23 In the\nclinic, activated PI3Kpathwayin tumors has been correlated with decreased response to\ntherapy and worse clinical outcomes.18,19\nIn addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling\naffecting sensitivity of cells to EGF receptor family signaling inhibitors. Specifically, the\nactivation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with\nHER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.24 In addition, pre-clinical\nstudies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM)and NSCLC cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse\nresistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models.20\nCollectively, these findings suggest thatPI3K/mTOR inhibitors may increase the efficacy of\nboth chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC)for the treatment\nof several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has shown clinical activity in several tumor\ntypes.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n1.3.7.1. Rationale for Combinations\n1.3.7.1.1. Docetaxel\nDocetaxel is a microtubule inhibitor which is active in a number of human solid tumors. In\npre-clinical invitrostudies, the combination of docetaxel and a PI3K inhibitor resulted in\nadditive and even synergistic activity in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Invivo\nexperiments revealed enhanced anti-tumorefficacy with the combination.16 Non-clinical\nexperiments in human NSCLC H1975 and H1650 xenograft models have demonstrated that\nthe combination of PF-05212384 and docetaxel is more effective than either drug alone\n(Figure4). Finally, patients with tumors with activated PI3K/Akt signaling have been shown\nto be less responsive to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including docetaxel and\npaclitaxel.17,18 The pre-clinical findings together with the clinical observations, suggest that\nthe addition of PF-05212384 to docetaxel may lead to enhanced antitumor effects in patients.\nFigure4.

Cisplatin\nCisplatin is an alkylatingagent which cross-links DNA. Preclinically, the combination of\nPI3K inhibitor and cisplatin resulted in synergistic anti-tumor activity in human ovarian\ncancer cell models.15 Furthermore, the combination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin\ndemonstrated increased anti-tumorefficacy in a breast PDX xenograft model (PJC10). Since\nsingle-agent cisplatin is active in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)the\ncombination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin may be an extremely effective regimen in an area\nof great medical need.24 Cisplatin is also used in combination with gemcitabine in a number\nof tumor types such as urothelial transitional cell cancers (TCC), NSCLC, and biliary tract\ntumors and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in ovarian cancer (OC).\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n1.3.7.2. Rationale for PF-05212384 Doses\nIn Phase1 study B2151001, single agent PF-05212384 at doses ranging from 10mg to\n319mg weekly (QW) were evaluated in 77patients with advanced solid tumors. The MTD\nwas identified as 154mg QW. In study B1271002, PF-05212384 doses of 95, 110, and\n130mg/week were evaluated in combination with irinotecan 180mg/m2 every 2weeks; the\nMTD of PF-05212384 was 110mg/week when dosed in combination with irinotecan.\nIn the current trial, the PF-05212384 starting dose inall 3treatment arms will be 90mg/week\nwhich is 58% of the MTD for single agent PF-05212384 and slightly lower than the lowest\ndose evaluated in Phase 2 study B1271002 investigating PF-05212384 in combination with\nirinotecan. In the Phase 1 FIH trial (B2151001), PF-05212384 dose of 89mg/week (n=4)\nwas found to result in drug concentrations above the target concentration for approximately\n70hours.\n1.3.7.3. Rationale for Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Dacomitinib Starting Doses\nIn Arm A, the starting dose of docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2 every 3weeks. This is the dose\nrecommended in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, in\ncombination with prednisone in hormone refractoryprostate cancer, and as single agent in\nNSCLC.28\nIn Arm B, the starting dose of cisplatin will be 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks which is the dose\noften used when it is administered as an every 3 week regimenin combination with\ndocetaxel,gemcitabine,or pemetrexed.29,30,31\nIn Arm C, the starting dose of dacomitinibwill be 30mg which is 67% of the MTD for\nsingle agent dacomitinib when administered orally once daily on a continuous dosing\nschedule. This starting dose was selected given the potential for overlapping toxicity with\nPF-05212384,such as mucositis and rash. In the dacomitinib FIH trial in patients with\nadvanced tumors, among 111patients treated in dose-escalation, 13 were treated at the\n30mg/day dose level. One DLT (mucositis) was observed in this group. The safety profile\nin the specific dose levels was not reported.32 As described in the IB, the 30mgdose has\nonly been evaluated in a small number patients in subsequent trialshowever the 30mgdose\nis generally better tolerated than the 45mg dose.\nDuring the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in\nindividual patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose (Section 5.2.5).\n1.4. Overall Risk Benefit Assessment\nPfizer considers that the results of the nonclinical toxicity and safety pharmacologystudies,\ntogether with the clinical experience obtained to date with PF-05212384 support the\ncontinued development of PF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents. The\ntumor types in which these combinations will likely be used, all represent areas of high\nmedical need.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 49\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

STUDY DESIGN\nThis is a Phase1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,\ntolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination\nwith anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid\ntumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selecteddoses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3independent\narms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in\nother (monotherapy) studies, the studywill test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinibin order to select the best dose to\nadminister in the MTD expansion portion of the study.\nA modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed\nDLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose\nselected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the\nadjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs.

If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose\nescalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur\nsimultaneously (as shown in Table8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the\npreceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT\nobserved in 3patients or ≤1 DLT in 6patients for each of them.\nAt each dose level,up to 3patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT.\nSubsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level\nhave been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs\namong those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.\n3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)\nSeverity of adverseevents will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose\nof dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of\ntreatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle2 Day1) which are possibly\nattributable to the combinationwill be classified as DLTs:\n• Hematologic:\n• Grade4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.\n• Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥ Grade3 and a single body\ntemperature>38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one\nhour).\n• Grade≥3 neutropenia with infection.\n• Grade3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.\n• Grade4 thrombocytopenia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Non-hematologic:\n• Grade≥2 pneumonitis.\n• Grade≥3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that have not been\nmaximally treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, rash,\nmucositis).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3of\nthe 4doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle(including the lead-in dose).\n• Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to\ndeliver at least 3of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the\nlead-in dose).\n• Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at\nleast 3of the 4doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle\n(including the lead-in dose(s)).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second\ncycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start.\n• In an asymptomatic patient, Grade3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501msec)\nwill first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction\nof reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation.\nIf, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade3 QTc prolongation\npersists, then the event should be considered a DLT.\n3.3. MTD Definition\nFor Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to\nSection9for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.\n3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC\nBased on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with\nimplementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall\nsafety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC.

Amendment 5 Study Design\n3.4.1. Dose Rationale\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4.

In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study.

Recommended Dose Modifications\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity,dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described\nbelow. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved. Chemotherapy (ie, docetaxel and cisplatin) should be\nmaintained at the starting dose unless a chemotherapy-related toxicity mandates a dose\nreduction.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products.

Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384.

Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always\nconsidered source document and must be filed accordingly.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nPatients must complete these instrumentsin clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to\nhaving any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel\nat the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

    "1.3.1. PI3K/mTOR": "PI3Ks constitute a lipid kinase family involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes,\nincluding proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal organization, and glucose transport.1 PI3K\nenzymes catalyze the formationof the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4,\n5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates many target proteins, most notably\nphosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1(PDK1). The downstream targets of these protein\nkinases, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BCL2-associated agonist of cell\ndeath (BAD) and forkhead box O proteins (FOXOs), mediate most of the proliferation,\ngrowth and survival signaling from PI3Ks (Figure 3).2,3 Activation of the PI3K pathway has\nbeen implicated in a wide variety of human cancers. Mutations in\nphosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), the gene\nencoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, are very common in human cancers, having been\nobserved in prostate, and colorectal tumors, among others. Phosphatase and tensin homolog\n(PTEN) deletion, leading to activation of Akt has been observed in many types of\nmalignancies including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma.4\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 36\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has\nbeen described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying\nmechanisms of action including taxanesand deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA)-damaging\nagents.15,16 In the clinic, activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased\nresponse to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.17,18,19 In addition to resistance to cytotoxic\nagents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to EGF signaling\ninhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse\noutcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.18\nFinally, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation\nin glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have\ndemonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor\nmodels.20",

    "1.3.5.1. PF-05212384 Plus Cisplatin in Patients with TNBC": "The rationale for combining cisplatin with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or\nlocally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) is\ntwo-fold: First, there is amplified genomic instability of TNBC tumor cells, leading to an\nincreased vulnerability of TNBC to DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin. TNBC tumor\ncells harbor activating mutations in thePIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets\nfor inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384.46\nIn addition, somefraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair\ngenes breast cancer1 (BRCA1)and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit\nin the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. The inability to repair\nDNA efficiently makes these cells particularlysusceptible to the DNA cross-link strand\nbreaks caused by platinating agents, like cisplatin.40,46\nThe use of cisplatin in combination regimens in patients with TNBC has shown improved\nrates of tumor response in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting.40,50 As such, recent\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN)guidelines for treatment of metastatic\nTNBC have included platinum salts, such as cisplatin.51\nThe above information provides a sound rationale for combining PF-05212384 with cisplatin\nin the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC.",

Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of\nthe HER family through binding at the adenose triphosphate (ATP) binding site, which\nresults in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. HER-1 and -2\nreceptor mutations and amplification have been investigated as possible favorable predictors\nof clinical efficacy and, in particular, it has been shown that patients with certain mutations\nof EGFR (exon 19deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) have significant benefit from\nEGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).

The MTD\nwas identified as 154mg QW. In study B1271002, PF-05212384 doses of 95, 110, and\n130mg/week were evaluated in combination with irinotecan 180mg/m2 every 2weeks; the\nMTD of PF-05212384 was 110mg/week when dosed in combination with irinotecan.\nIn the current trial, the PF-05212384 starting dose inall 3treatment arms will be 90mg/week\nwhich is 58% of the MTD for single agent PF-05212384 and slightly lower than the lowest\ndose evaluated in Phase 2 study B1271002 investigating PF-05212384 in combination with\nirinotecan. In the Phase 1 FIH trial (B2151001), PF-05212384 dose of 89mg/week (n=4)\nwas found to result in drug concentrations above the target concentration for approximately\n70hours.",
    "1.3.7.3. Rationale for Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Dacomitinib Starting Doses": "In Arm A, the starting dose of docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2 every 3weeks. This is the dose\nrecommended in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, in\ncombination with prednisone in hormone refractoryprostate cancer, and as single agent in\nNSCLC.28\nIn Arm B, the starting dose of cisplatin will be 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks which is the dose\noften used when it is administered as an every 3 week regimenin combination with\ndocetaxel,gemcitabine,or pemetrexed.29,30,31\nIn Arm C, the starting dose of dacomitinibwill be 30mg which is 67% of the MTD for\nsingle agent dacomitinib when administered orally once daily on a continuous dosing\nschedule. This starting dose was selected given the potential for overlapping toxicity with\nPF-05212384,such as mucositis and rash. In the dacomitinib FIH trial in patients with\nadvanced tumors, among 111patients treated in dose-escalation, 13 were treated at the\n30mg/day dose level. One DLT (mucositis) was observed in this group. The safety profile\nin the specific dose levels was not reported.32 As described in the IB, the 30mgdose has\nonly been evaluated in a small number patients in subsequent trialshowever the 30mgdose\nis generally better tolerated than the 45mg dose.\nDuring the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in\nindividual patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose (Section 5.2.5).",

STUDY DESIGN\nThis is a Phase1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,\ntolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination\nwith anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid\ntumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selecteddoses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3independent\narms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in\nother (monotherapy) studies, the studywill test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinibin order to select the best dose to\nadminister in the MTD expansion portion of the study.\nA modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed\nDLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose\nselected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the\nadjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate\nconcurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384,\nazone-baseddesign will be utilized, which is a modified3+3design that potentially allows\nopening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will\nproceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is\nreached.\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 52\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nTo understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period\nwill be included. A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to\nCycle1 Day1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C). The lead in\nperiod duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on\nthe PK profile observed during the lead in period. Patients will then receive study treatment\non an outpatient basis in21day cycles.\nTreatment with study drug will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity,\na decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is terminated.\nPatients experiencing toxicity or a DLT may be managed with dose modificationor\ndiscontinuation. If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner(cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of\npatient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or\ndacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsoron a case-by-case basis.\nThe proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK timepoints may be reconsidered and amended\nduring the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.\n3.1. Dose Levels to Be Tested\nThe possible dose levels for ArmsA, B, and C are shown in Table7. For Arms A and B,\ndose levels differ only in the dose of PF-05212384. For Arm C, dose levels differ for\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib.\nDuring the dose-escalation portion, patients who have not experienced DLT at the lower\ndoses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has\nnot been determined to exceed the MTD). The decision regarding the implementation of\nintra-patient dose escalation in patients treated at the MTD expansion will be considered\nonce the MTD has been identified.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 54\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n3.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignment\n3.1.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignments for Arms A and B\nIn Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment\nbased on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical\ndescription of the method is provided in Section 9. The dose assignment recommendations\nof themethod are provided in Figure7. Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3patients. In the\nfirst cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted inTable7. For any subsequent\ncohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total\nnumber of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level.\nFor example, if a cohort of 3patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of\nthem experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be\nto stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected\ndose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are\ntreated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number\nof patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1,\nthus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 56\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40evaluable patients per arm has been\nreached.\n• A minimum of 10 evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD.\nDLTs occurring in the first cycle will be used for determining the startingdose in the\nsubsequent cohort.\nAll significant AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Sponsorand the Investigators to\ndetermine if the dose allocation schedule requires modification.\n3.1.1.2. Criteria for Dose Assignment for Arm C\nA zone-baseddesign will be employedfor Arm C.35 It is amodified3+3design that\npotentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time. The starting dose\nlevel is C1. Dose escalation will proceed according to the sequence in Table8until an MTD\n(or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Doseis reached.\nTable8.

If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose\nescalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur\nsimultaneously (as shown in Table8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the\npreceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT\nobserved in 3patients or ≤1 DLT in 6patients for each of them.\nAt each dose level,up to 3patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT.\nSubsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level\nhave been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs\namong those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.\n3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)\nSeverity of adverseevents will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose\nof dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of\ntreatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle2 Day1) which are possibly\nattributable to the combinationwill be classified as DLTs:\n• Hematologic:\n• Grade4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.\n• Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥ Grade3 and a single body\ntemperature>38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one\nhour).\n• Grade≥3 neutropenia with infection.\n• Grade3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.\n• Grade4 thrombocytopenia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Non-hematologic:\n• Grade≥2 pneumonitis.\n• Grade≥3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that have not been\nmaximally treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, rash,\nmucositis).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3of\nthe 4doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle(including the lead-in dose).\n• Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to\ndeliver at least 3of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the\nlead-in dose).\n• Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at\nleast 3of the 4doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle\n(including the lead-in dose(s)).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second\ncycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start.\n• In an asymptomatic patient, Grade3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501msec)\nwill first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction\nof reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation.\nIf, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade3 QTc prolongation\npersists, then the event should be considered a DLT.\n3.3. MTD Definition\nFor Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to\nSection9for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.\n3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC\nBased on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with\nimplementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall\nsafety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC.

Amendment 5 Study Design\n3.4.1. Dose Rationale\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4. PATIENT SELECTION\nThis study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patientsare enrolled.

In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy.

This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Vital Signs and Physical Examination\nPatients will have a physical exam to include an examination of major body systems and an\nassessment for emergent toxicities or changes from prior visits, weight,vital signs (blood\npressure and heart rate to be recorded in the sittingpositionafter approximately 5minutes of\nrest), assessment of ECOG performance status and height; height will be measured at\nbaseline only. Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three\nconsecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2minutes apart to determine the mean\nQTc interval. If the mean QTc is prolonged (≥501msec, ie, ≥ CTC AE Grade3), then the\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 94\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the\nfinding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate.\nIf manual reading verifies a QTc of≥501msec, immediate correction for reversible causes\n(including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the\npotential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.\nIn addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3hours until\nthe QTc interval falls below 501msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit.

Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7.

A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4.

Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.

Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified.

The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.",

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only.

This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

The product label will supersede any instructions in the IB for\nPF-05212384. If the investigational product does not appear to be visually appropriate (eg,\nbroken vial), it should not be administered and the Sponsorshould be contacted immediately\nfor further instruction.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 85\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3.2. Docetaxel and Cisplatin\nDocetaxel and cisplatinstorage conditions aredescribed in the product label foreach drug.\n5.3.3. Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.

Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three\nconsecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2minutes apart to determine the mean\nQTc interval.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit.

Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures.

A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4.

Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.

Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades.

Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)\nIt is the responsibility of the Investigatorto have prospective approval of the study protocol,\nprotocol amendments,informed consent documents,and other relevant documents,\neg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with\nthe IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should\nbe forwarded to Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 120\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is\nwhere the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In\nthat event, the Investigatormust notifythe IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately after\nthe implementation.\n12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as\nthe general principles set forth in the International EthicalGuidelines for Biomedical\nResearch Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical\nSciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH1996), and theDeclaration of Helsinki (World\nMedical Association1996,2008).\nIn addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICHguideline\non GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.\n12.3. PatientInformation and Consent\nAll parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names\non any Sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, except where\nrequired by laws.\nPatient names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical\ncode consisting of a numbering system provided by Pfizerin order to de-identify the trial\npatient. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and\nprotection of patient personal data.\nThe informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory\nrequirements, and legal requirements.\nThe informed consent document used during the informed consent process must be reviewed\nby the Sponsor, approved by both the IRB/IEC and available for inspection.\nThe Investigatormust ensure that each study patient, or his/her legal representative, is fully\ninformed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with\nparticipation.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will obtainwritten informed\nconsent from each patient or the patient's legal representative before any study-specific\nactivity is performed. The Investigatorwill retain the original of each patient's signed\nconsent document.\n12.4.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer\nPfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the\nresults of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trial\nDatabase (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with\napplicable local laws/regulations.\nIn all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and\ncomplete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in\nwhich the study was conducted.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 122\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\nPfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.govfor Pfizer-sponsored\ninterventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer\nproduct regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.

Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen. Potential reasons for non-compliant dosing (ie, AEs, lost medication) will be\nfollowed up by the study site personnel and strategies to improve dosing compliance will be\nexplored.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 84\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

If the investigational product does not appear to be visually appropriate (eg,\nbroken vial), it should not be administered and the Sponsorshould be contacted immediately\nfor further instruction.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 85\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3.2. Docetaxel and Cisplatin\nDocetaxel and cisplatinstorage conditions aredescribed in the product label foreach drug.\n5.3.3. Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three\nconsecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2minutes apart to determine the mean\nQTc interval. If the mean QTc is prolonged (≥501msec, ie, ≥ CTC AE Grade3), then the\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 94\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the\nfinding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate.\nIf manual reading verifies a QTc of≥501msec, immediate correction for reversible causes\n(including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the\npotential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.\nIn addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3hours until\nthe QTc interval falls below 501msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit.

Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit\nresponse includes PR, CR and SD (≥24weeks from the first dose to treatment failure).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 115\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose. The means and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from\nthe model will be back-transformed to provide means and 90% CIs for the accumulation and\nlinearity ratios for each dose.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 116\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nTrough concentrations will be plotted for each dose using a box-whisker plot by cycle and\nday within cycle in order to assess the attainment of steady-state.\n9.5.1.1. Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient.

In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)\nIt is the responsibility of the Investigatorto have prospective approval of the study protocol,\nprotocol amendments,informed consent documents,and other relevant documents,\neg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with\nthe IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.",

Life Style Guidelines\nPatients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Recommended Dose Modifications\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity,dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described\nbelow. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer.

Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always\nconsidered source document and must be filed accordingly.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nPatients must complete these instrumentsin clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to\nhaving any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel\nat the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type.

Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11.

DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator.

Life Style Guidelines\nPatients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Recommended Dose Modifications\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity,dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described\nbelow. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired. Paired tumor biopsies are also required from patients treated in the MTD cohorts\n(see Section 7.3).\nFollowing completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients\nmay be enrolled.\nFor screening procedures see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.2. Study Period\nFor treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.3. Follow-up Visit\nFor follow-up procedures see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.4. PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always\nconsidered source document and must be filed accordingly.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nPatients must complete these instrumentsin clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to\nhaving any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel\nat the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9.

In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use.

Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation. For Arm\nA, the day treatment is restarted with docetaxel will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle,\nand the previous cycle is extended accordingly. If a patient experiences unacceptable\ntoxicities considered to be related only to docetaxel and not to PF-05212384, continuation of\npatient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with\nthe Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nCisplatin: If toxicities persist and cisplatin cannot be re-administered for >2 weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of cisplatin in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contacted to discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved. Chemotherapy (ie, docetaxel and cisplatin) should be\nmaintained at the starting dose unless a chemotherapy-related toxicity mandates a dose\nreduction.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1. PF-05212384\nPF-05212384 should be stored as indicated in its original labeled carton, per the labeled\nstorage conditions.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.

Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy.

Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6.

EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

STUDY DESIGN\nThis is a Phase1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,\ntolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination\nwith anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid\ntumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selecteddoses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3independent\narms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in\nother (monotherapy) studies, the studywill test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinibin order to select the best dose to\nadminister in the MTD expansion portion of the study.\nA modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed\nDLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose\nselected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the\nadjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate\nconcurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384,\nazone-baseddesign will be utilized, which is a modified3+3design that potentially allows\nopening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will\nproceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is\nreached.\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 52\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nTo understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period\nwill be included. A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to\nCycle1 Day1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).

If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner(cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of\npatient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or\ndacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsoron a case-by-case basis.\nThe proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK timepoints may be reconsidered and amended\nduring the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.\n3.1. Dose Levels to Be Tested\nThe possible dose levels for ArmsA, B, and C are shown in Table7. For Arms A and B,\ndose levels differ only in the dose of PF-05212384. For Arm C, dose levels differ for\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib.\nDuring the dose-escalation portion, patients who have not experienced DLT at the lower\ndoses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has\nnot been determined to exceed the MTD). The decision regarding the implementation of\nintra-patient dose escalation in patients treated at the MTD expansion will be considered\nonce the MTD has been identified.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 54\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n3.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignment\n3.1.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignments for Arms A and B\nIn Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment\nbased on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical\ndescription of the method is provided in Section 9. The dose assignment recommendations\nof themethod are provided in Figure7. Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3patients. In the\nfirst cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted inTable7. For any subsequent\ncohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total\nnumber of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level.\nFor example, if a cohort of 3patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of\nthem experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be\nto stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected\ndose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are\ntreated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number\nof patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1,\nthus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 56\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40evaluable patients per arm has been\nreached.\n• A minimum of 10 evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD.\nDLTs occurring in the first cycle will be used for determining the startingdose in the\nsubsequent cohort.\nAll significant AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Sponsorand the Investigators to\ndetermine if the dose allocation schedule requires modification.\n3.1.1.2. Criteria for Dose Assignment for Arm C\nA zone-baseddesign will be employedfor Arm C.35 It is amodified3+3design that\npotentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.

If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose\nescalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur\nsimultaneously (as shown in Table8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the\npreceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT\nobserved in 3patients or ≤1 DLT in 6patients for each of them.\nAt each dose level,up to 3patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT.\nSubsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level\nhave been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs\namong those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.\n3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)\nSeverity of adverseevents will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose\nof dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of\ntreatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle2 Day1) which are possibly\nattributable to the combinationwill be classified as DLTs:\n• Hematologic:\n• Grade4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.\n• Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥ Grade3 and a single body\ntemperature>38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one\nhour).\n• Grade≥3 neutropenia with infection.\n• Grade3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.\n• Grade4 thrombocytopenia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Non-hematologic:\n• Grade≥2 pneumonitis.\n• Grade≥3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that have not been\nmaximally treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, rash,\nmucositis).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3of\nthe 4doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle(including the lead-in dose).\n• Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to\ndeliver at least 3of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the\nlead-in dose).\n• Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at\nleast 3of the 4doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle\n(including the lead-in dose(s)).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second\ncycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start.\n• In an asymptomatic patient, Grade3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501msec)\nwill first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction\nof reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation.\nIf, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade3 QTc prolongation\npersists, then the event should be considered a DLT.\n3.3. MTD Definition\nFor Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to\nSection9for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.\n3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC\nBased on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with\nimplementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall\nsafety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC.

Amendment 5 Study Design\n3.4.1. Dose Rationale\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study.

In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen. Potential reasons for non-compliant dosing (ie, AEs, lost medication) will be\nfollowed up by the study site personnel and strategies to improve dosing compliance will be\nexplored.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 84\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always\nconsidered source document and must be filed accordingly.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nPatients must complete these instrumentsin clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to\nhaving any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel\nat the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit\nresponse includes PR, CR and SD (≥24weeks from the first dose to treatment failure).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 115\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11.

The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

STUDY DESIGN\nThis is a Phase1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,\ntolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination\nwith anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid\ntumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selecteddoses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3independent\narms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in\nother (monotherapy) studies, the studywill test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinibin order to select the best dose to\nadminister in the MTD expansion portion of the study.\nA modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed\nDLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose\nselected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the\nadjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate\nconcurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384,\nazone-baseddesign will be utilized, which is a modified3+3design that potentially allows\nopening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will\nproceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is\nreached.\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established.

A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to\nCycle1 Day1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C). The lead in\nperiod duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on\nthe PK profile observed during the lead in period.

If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner(cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of\npatient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or\ndacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsoron a case-by-case basis.\nThe proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK timepoints may be reconsidered and amended\nduring the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.\n3.1. Dose Levels to Be Tested\nThe possible dose levels for ArmsA, B, and C are shown in Table7. For Arms A and B,\ndose levels differ only in the dose of PF-05212384. For Arm C, dose levels differ for\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib.\nDuring the dose-escalation portion, patients who have not experienced DLT at the lower\ndoses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has\nnot been determined to exceed the MTD).

Criteria for Dose Assignment\n3.1.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignments for Arms A and B\nIn Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment\nbased on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical\ndescription of the method is provided in Section 9. The dose assignment recommendations\nof themethod are provided in Figure7. Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3patients. In the\nfirst cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted inTable7. For any subsequent\ncohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total\nnumber of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level.\nFor example, if a cohort of 3patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of\nthem experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be\nto stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected\ndose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are\ntreated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number\nof patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1,\nthus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 56\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40evaluable patients per arm has been\nreached.\n• A minimum of 10 evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD.\nDLTs occurring in the first cycle will be used for determining the startingdose in the\nsubsequent cohort.\nAll significant AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Sponsorand the Investigators to\ndetermine if the dose allocation schedule requires modification.\n3.1.1.2. Criteria for Dose Assignment for Arm C\nA zone-baseddesign will be employedfor Arm C.35 It is amodified3+3design that\npotentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time. The starting dose\nlevel is C1. Dose escalation will proceed according to the sequence in Table8until an MTD\n(or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Doseis reached.\nTable8.

If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose\nescalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur\nsimultaneously (as shown in Table8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the\npreceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT\nobserved in 3patients or ≤1 DLT in 6patients for each of them.\nAt each dose level,up to 3patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT.\nSubsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level\nhave been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs\namong those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.\n3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)\nSeverity of adverseevents will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose\nof dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of\ntreatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle2 Day1) which are possibly\nattributable to the combinationwill be classified as DLTs:\n• Hematologic:\n• Grade4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.\n• Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥ Grade3 and a single body\ntemperature>38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one\nhour).\n• Grade≥3 neutropenia with infection.\n• Grade3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.\n• Grade4 thrombocytopenia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Non-hematologic:\n• Grade≥2 pneumonitis.\n• Grade≥3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that have not been\nmaximally treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, rash,\nmucositis).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3of\nthe 4doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle(including the lead-in dose).\n• Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to\ndeliver at least 3of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the\nlead-in dose).\n• Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at\nleast 3of the 4doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle\n(including the lead-in dose(s)).\n• Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second\ncycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start.\n• In an asymptomatic patient, Grade3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501msec)\nwill first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction\nof reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation.\nIf, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade3 QTc prolongation\npersists, then the event should be considered a DLT.\n3.3. MTD Definition\nFor Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to\nSection9for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.\n3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC\nBased on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with\nimplementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall\nsafety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC. The\ndesign is shown in the Figure8below.\nTreatment in the expansion portion of the study will continue until progression of disease,\nuncontrollable toxicity, a decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or\nthe study is terminated.

Amendment 5 Study Design\n3.4.1. Dose Rationale\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4. PATIENT SELECTION\nThis study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patientsare enrolled.

In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

Successive cohorts of patients will receive selecteddoses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3independent\narms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in\nother (monotherapy) studies, the studywill test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in\ncombination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinibin order to select the best dose to\nadminister in the MTD expansion portion of the study.\nA modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed\nDLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose\nselected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the\nadjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs.

Criteria for Dose Assignment\n3.1.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignments for Arms A and B\nIn Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment\nbased on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical\ndescription of the method is provided in Section 9. The dose assignment recommendations\nof themethod are provided in Figure7. Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3patients. In the\nfirst cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted inTable7. For any subsequent\ncohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total\nnumber of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level.\nFor example, if a cohort of 3patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of\nthem experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be\nto stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected\ndose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are\ntreated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number\nof patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1,\nthus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 56\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40evaluable patients per arm has been\nreached.\n• A minimum of 10 evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD.\nDLTs occurring in the first cycle will be used for determining the startingdose in the\nsubsequent cohort.\nAll significant AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Sponsorand the Investigators to\ndetermine if the dose allocation schedule requires modification.\n3.1.1.2.

If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose\nescalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur\nsimultaneously (as shown in Table8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the\npreceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT\nobserved in 3patients or ≤1 DLT in 6patients for each of them.\nAt each dose level,up to 3patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT.\nSubsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level\nhave been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs\namong those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.\n3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms)\nSeverity of adverseevents will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03.

MTD Definition\nFor Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to\nSection9for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.\n3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC\nBased on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with\nimplementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall\nsafety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC.

Amendment 5 Study Design\n3.4.1. Dose Rationale\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4.

The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation. For Arm\nA, the day treatment is restarted with docetaxel will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle,\nand the previous cycle is extended accordingly. If a patient experiences unacceptable\ntoxicities considered to be related only to docetaxel and not to PF-05212384, continuation of\npatient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with\nthe Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nCisplatin: If toxicities persist and cisplatin cannot be re-administered for >2 weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of cisplatin in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contacted to discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved. Chemotherapy (ie, docetaxel and cisplatin) should be\nmaintained at the starting dose unless a chemotherapy-related toxicity mandates a dose\nreduction.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1. PF-05212384\nPF-05212384 should be stored as indicated in its original labeled carton, per the labeled\nstorage conditions.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.

Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy.

Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6.

EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4.

Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

Patients not evaluable for\nassessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, maybe replaced. Dose escalation will\ncontinue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in\nat least 2 of the 3-6patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that anMTD has\nbeen exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6patients per dose cohort however, based upon\nobserved toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded\nbeyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the\nInvestigators. When a doselevel exceeding anMTD has been identified, the next lower dose\nlevel is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that doselevel.\nOtherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower doselevel, and if zero or\n1patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD.\nFor Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsorin\nagreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational\ndose level to enroll additional patients.",

Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated\nat the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity.\nFor Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will\nbe treated at the MTD to better define the tolerabilityand to evaluate clinical activity.",

    "3.4.1. Dose Rationale": "The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)that will be used in the safety and efficacy\nexpansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The\ndetermination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile,\nclinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD.\nA total of 33patients were enrolled in ArmB at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm\n(B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310mg dose level (Grade3 oral mucositis)\nleading to a dose reductionto 260mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then\nobserved at the 260mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore,\nthe 310mg and 260mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset\noral mucositis.\nBased on safety profile at 310mg and 260mg, the dose level selected for additional study in\n10patients was 215mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215mg, 6dose reductions (to 180mg\nand one patient then further reduced to 150mg) were observed in 5patients during Cycle1.\nFive PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or\nother significant toxicities.\nBased upon this safety profile at the 215mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV\nweekly PF-05212384in combination with cisplatin (75mg/mg2 IV q3wks).\n4.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only.

Compliance\n5.2.8.1. PF-05212384, Docetaxel, and Cisplatin\nThe site will complete required dosage Preparation Record located in the study manual. The\nuse of the Preparation Record is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing\nappropriate clinical site documentation system. The existing clinical site's documentation\nsystem should capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and\nadministration of the dose. This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen. Potential reasons for non-compliant dosing (ie, AEs, lost medication) will be\nfollowed up by the study site personnel and strategies to improve dosing compliance will be\nexplored.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 84\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1. PF-05212384\nPF-05212384 should be stored as indicated in its original labeled carton, per the labeled\nstorage conditions. The product label will supersede any instructions in the IB for\nPF-05212384. If the investigational product does not appear to be visually appropriate (eg,\nbroken vial), it should not be administered and the Sponsorshould be contacted immediately\nfor further instruction.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 85\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.3.2. Docetaxel and Cisplatin\nDocetaxel and cisplatinstorage conditions aredescribed in the product label foreach drug.\n5.3.3. Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Vital Signs and Physical Examination\nPatients will have a physical exam to include an examination of major body systems and an\nassessment for emergent toxicities or changes from prior visits, weight,vital signs (blood\npressure and heart rate to be recorded in the sittingpositionafter approximately 5minutes of\nrest), assessment of ECOG performance status and height; height will be measured at\nbaseline only. Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three\nconsecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2minutes apart to determine the mean\nQTc interval. If the mean QTc is prolonged (≥501msec, ie, ≥ CTC AE Grade3), then the\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 94\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the\nfinding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate.\nIf manual reading verifies a QTc of≥501msec, immediate correction for reversible causes\n(including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the\npotential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.\nIn addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3hours until\nthe QTc interval falls below 501msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6.

The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4.

Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades.

Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

Recommended Dose Modifications\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity,dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described\nbelow. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst\ntoxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence\nof any adverse symptom.\nDose modifications may occur in three ways:\n• Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given\ntreatment cycle.\n• Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the\nprevious cycle.\n• In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle.\n5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay\nPF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld\nare counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is\nrestarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day1 of the next cycle, and the previous\ncycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks\ndue to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the studydrug,\nfollowing discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities\nconsidered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin,\ndocetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the\ncombination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed\nwith the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.\nDocetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2weeks after the\nexpected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35days from the start of docetaxel in the\ncurrent cycle), the Sponsorshould be contactedto discuss treatment continuation.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral\ncavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report\nbetween visits.\nConsultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of\nadequate caloric intake.\n6. STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired. Paired tumor biopsies are also required from patients treated in the MTD cohorts\n(see Section 7.3).\nFollowing completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients\nmay be enrolled.\nFor screening procedures see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.2. Study Period\nFor treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.3. Follow-up Visit\nFor follow-up procedures see Schedule of Activitiesand Section 7.\n6.4. PatientWithdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be\nwithdrawnat any timeat the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsorfor safetyor behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study\nvisits or procedures at a given study site.\nReasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:\n• Objective disease progression according to RECIST;\n• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIf the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsorwill make\nreasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to\nprovide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long\nas appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the\ntreatment is authorizedand commercially available for this use.\n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nPatient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific\ndisease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC\nQLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23)\n(Appendix10and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at\npre-dose on Day1 and Day8 of Cycle1 and 2, on Day1 of each subsequent cycle starting\nwith Cycle3 and at theend of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always\nconsidered source document and must be filed accordingly.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nPatients must complete these instrumentsin clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to\nhaving any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel\nat the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances\n(eg,patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit\nresponse includes PR, CR and SD (≥24weeks from the first dose to treatment failure).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 115\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Vital Signs and Physical Examination\nPatients will have a physical exam to include an examination of major body systems and an\nassessment for emergent toxicities or changes from prior visits, weight,vital signs (blood\npressure and heart rate to be recorded in the sittingpositionafter approximately 5minutes of\nrest), assessment of ECOG performance status and height; height will be measured at\nbaseline only. Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three\nconsecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2minutes apart to determine the mean\nQTc interval. If the mean QTc is prolonged (≥501msec, ie, ≥ CTC AE Grade3), then the\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 94\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the\nfinding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate.\nIf manual reading verifies a QTc of≥501msec, immediate correction for reversible causes\n(including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the\npotential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.\nIn addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3hours until\nthe QTc interval falls below 501msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens\nWhole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle1 Day1 and Cycle2 Day15\npost-dose, but nomore than 72hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6.

The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR.

Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)\nIt is the responsibility of the Investigatorto have prospective approval of the study protocol,\nprotocol amendments,informed consent documents,and other relevant documents,\neg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with\nthe IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

Life Style Guidelines\nPatients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Dacomitinib\nDacomitinibtablets should be stored as indicated, according to thelabeled storage conditions\n(which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006\nshould be followed.37\nErythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of\nanemia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 88\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n5.4.8. Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged.

Life Style Guidelines\nPatients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special\nprecautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the\npatients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds,\ntanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock\ndaily.\nIn this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for\nwhich the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective\ncontraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90days after the last\ndose. The investigatoror his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two\nappropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of\ncontraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The\ninvestigatoror his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to\nuse highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation\nin the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is\nknown or suspected.\nHighly effectivemethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a\nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie,perfect use) and\ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of\ncontraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment\nthroughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an\nadequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n2.

SponsorQualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the\ntrial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical\nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains,\nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number,\ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event\nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question\nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients\nparticipation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if\nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in\nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and\nthe study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the\nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for\nadvice on medical questions or problemsthat may arise during the study. The help desk\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they\nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1.

Dose Reductions\nFollowing dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to\nbe reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in\nthe combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first\ncycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the\nprevious cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles\nshould be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reductionis required. Dose\nre-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple\ntoxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.\nSuggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this\nstudy. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and\nresumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator.\nArms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of\nPF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once\nadequate recovery is achieved.

This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after\napproval from the Pfizer monitor.\n5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib\nPatients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, orsignificantly delayed\ndoses (ie, >6hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused\nstudy medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tabletsreturned by the\npatient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially\nempty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and\nheld at the site until monitored.\nThe Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study\nregimen.

Drug Storage and Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial\ndrug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels,\nand in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should\nthe Investigatoror other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or\nclinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior\nauthorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or\nmay approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must\nidentify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition\non a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be\nsigned by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer.\nAdequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs\nmust be kept. Study drug (vials andtablets) must be used according to the protocol\ndirections. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To\nensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form\nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized\nby Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the\npatients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes\ndestruction at the trial site, the Investigatormust ensure that the materials are destroyed in\ncompliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special\ninstructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nInvestigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by\nusing alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working\ncorrectly as required for proper storageof investigational products. These include\nthermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature\nexcursions should be reported to the sponsor.\nThe investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage\nrequirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor.\nOnce a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used\nuntil the Sponsorprovides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.\nStorage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet\n[CDS], United States Package Insert[USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics[SPC], or\nLocal Product Document[LPD] may be superseded by thelabel storage.\n5.3.1.

Patients should be\ninstructed to keep their medication in its original container.\n5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)\nPalliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the\nInvestigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical\nOncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as\ninterventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until\nthe End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF.\nPrimary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they\nmay be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO\nguidelines.\nPatients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the\ntreatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate\ntherapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise\nagreed by the Investigatorin consultation with theSponsor.\nPatients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients\non study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with\nwarfarin be initiated.\nAdditionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be\ndiscontinued 24hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24hours\nafterthe end of PF-05212384 infusion.\nPatients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nThe docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may\napply for concomitant medications.\n5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4\nIn all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4\ninhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nBecause inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a\npotential increase in toxicities, theuse of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4\nInhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges,\npomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,\nfosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem,\ndelavirdine, imatinib,tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days\nprior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation.Aprepitant is\nclassified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative\ncan be identified.\nStudy drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers\n(eg,phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,\nSt.John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of\nstudy drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted\nfrom 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384until study treatment discontinuation.\n5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only)\nDacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30ng/mL).\nDrug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on\nthe systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of\nthe CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6\nmetabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg,procainamide, pimozide and thioridazineare\nprohibited in combination with dacomitinib.\nThe use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires\nconsideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism.\nSubstitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions\nbelow should be followed.\n• Fordrugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should\nbe based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting\ndose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with\ndacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required.\n• For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high\nlikelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose\nreduction is required when starting dacomitinib,but clinical monitoring is required;\nbased on the patient’s response, dosereductions may be necessary.\n• Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol,\nshould be replaced withan alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to\nthe pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their\nexposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates\nsuch as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as\nsubstitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 87\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAppendix8provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the\ntherapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If\nthere is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator\nshould contact the Sponsorstudy team.\n5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only)\nConcurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a\nnarrow therapeutic index (eg,digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or\ntoxicities.\n5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only)\nLidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as\ndacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including\ntelemetry) is recommended.36\n5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs\nNo additional anti-tumortherapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted.\nLow dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or\nluteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s\ndiscretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\n5.4.6. Supportive Care\nPalliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the\nlesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigatorclearly\nindicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In\nview of the current lack of data about the interaction of theinvestigational agents\nPF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted\nduring palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5days before and resuming treatment after recovery\nof any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline.\nMedication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used\nat the Investigator’s discretion.\n5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia\nwill be permitted for Cycle1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2onwards,\naccording to local guidelines.

Corticosteroids\nChronic,systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5mg/day or\ndexamethasone ≥2mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with\ndocetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low\ndose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisoneor <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at\nthe Investigator’s discretionfor patients with CRPC on Arm A.\nSteroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed.\n5.4.9. Surgery\nCaution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The\nappropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the\nrisk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study\ntreatment is recommended at least 7days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to\nreinitiate studytreatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound\nhealing and recovery from surgery.\n5.4.10. Oral Mucositis –Prophylaxis and Management\nOral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin\ncombination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for\nprevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to\nbegin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day1 and continued as clinically indicated.\nPatients who have not had a dental checkup within 6months prior to start of dosing are\nencouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent\nchemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to\nundertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to\nproceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation.\nTo decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid\ncontaining “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml swish and expectorate,\nfour times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as\nclinically indicated.\nTopical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the\nInvestigator and according to local clinical practices.\nPatients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently\nand use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist\nswallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral\npain.\nUse ofchlorhexidine is to be avoided.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 89\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nBetween scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes\nin appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged.

STUDY PROCEDURES\nAll patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to\nany trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7and in the\nSchedule of Activities. Safetylaboratory tests (hematology, bloodchemistry, urinalysis,\ncoagulation)and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day1\nvisit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic\nvisit.\nOthertests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed\nfor patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these\nadditional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF.\n6.1. Screening\nAll patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed\nconsent form prior to performing any trial related proceduresthat are not standard of care.\nThe Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and\nrisks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial\nwitness,and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before\ninitiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug).\nThe final ICDmust be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)in language readily understood by the patient.\nThe Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the\npatient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the\ninformed consent discussion.\nThis protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial\nenrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activitiesand its footnotes).\nRequired screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3.\nPatients will be assigned individual trial identificationnumbers at the time they are approved\nand registered for enrollment.\nBaseline assessments must be performed within 28days (unless otherwise specified) prior to\ncommencing studytreatment, as outlinedon the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor\nbiopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient\nhas consented to a freshtumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the\nstart of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7days prior to Cycle1 Day1\n(Arms A and B) or 14days prior to Cycle1 Day1 (Arm C).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nAs part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical\nhistory, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital\nsigns, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and\ntriplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments.\nDocumentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or\ncytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment\nand radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen,tumor\ngrade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available\n(eg,PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CAmutation, PTEN loss]KRAS, BRAF,\nHER2 or EGFRgene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding\nthe sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected.\nThe required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c,\npregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis.\nConsent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor\nbiopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family\nreceptorand MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS,\nand BRAF. If anarchived biopsyis not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be\nrequired.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are\ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be\ncircumstances,outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to\nperform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the\nsafety and well being of the patient. When a protocol requiredtest cannot be performed the\nInvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions\nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.\nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination,\nECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory\nassessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be\ndetermined.\n7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing\nFor female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with\nsensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study\ntherapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study\ntreatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the\ninvestigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during\nthe active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one\nmenstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of\na positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from studymedication but may remain in\nthe study.\nAdditional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required\nby local regulations.\n7.1.2. Adverse Events\nAssessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the\nNational Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]\nversion 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events\nduring the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 93\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.1.3.

Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained\nphysician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation.\n7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG\nTriplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be\nused for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the\nstandard intervals automatically.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).\n7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements(Arm C only)\nDetermination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the\nend of Cycle3, the end of Cycle6, and then every 6cycles for Arm C patients only. The\nsame technique should be used throughout for an individual patient.\nIf an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the\nLVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if\navailable); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the\njudgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular\ndysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that\npatient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be\nrecorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of\nthe Investigator.\nFor any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular\ndysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4month interval to assess for\nresolution is recommended.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n7.2.

Tumor Biopsy\nAcquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides\nrepresenting primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to\nthe 28day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival\nFFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be\nenrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the\ntumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least\ntwenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided.\nSample will beanalyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA,\nBRCA1, other).\nThis study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling\npathways that could be modified in vivo bythe drugs used in this study. The biomarker\nstudies will be used to help understand the in vivomechanism of action of the agents, levels\nof pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing\nto the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways.\nTo meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre-and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched”\nfresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation andthe\nMTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD\ncohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a\ndiscussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is\nmade. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases\ndeep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver\nmetastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies\nobtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patientsin the expansion\nportion of the studyenrolling patients with TNBC.\nBiopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the\nSchedule of Activities. A formalin fixedparaffin block will be prepared and collected from\neach biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein\nbiomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug\nsensitivity (eg, emerging KRASmutation). Additional markers may be included as\npre-clinical studies or literature reportsfurther elucidate themechanisms of action of any of\nthe study drugs.

Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for\ncirculating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein\nmarkers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis.\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism\nA PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the\nPhase1 studies, administration of PF-05212384resulted in increased levels of circulating\nglucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations\nsuggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based\nbiomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will\ntherefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as\npharmacodynamics markers fordual PI3K/mTOR inhibition.\n7.4. Tumor Response Assessments\nTumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include\nthe chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order\nto monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or\nnon-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI\nscans if disease is being followed in these areas. Abrain CT or MRI scan for patients with\nknown or suspected brain metastasesand bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with\nknown or suspected bone metastasesare required.\nThe same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at\nbaseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.\nAnti-tumoractivity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at\nbaseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease\nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if\nnot done in the previous 6weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of\ncare within 28days of the lead-in dosebut prior to signing the ICDwill not need to have a\nre-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available\nfor entry onto the study CRF.\nAssessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44)\n.\n7.6.

The instruments will be given to the patient\nin theappropriate language for the site.\n7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and\nAppendix11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to\nclinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient\nreported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also\nwidely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease\nsymptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients.\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated\ninto five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\ndomains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item\nsymptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess\nadditional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation,\nand diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs\n284-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point\nLikert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales,\nhigher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100scale\nusing standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents\nmore severe symptoms.\nThe EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three\nsymptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering\nsexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective.\nBoth the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15minutes to\ncomplete and are available in many languages.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR.

Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose. The means and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from\nthe model will be back-transformed to provide means and 90% CIs for the accumulation and\nlinearity ratios for each dose.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 116\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nTrough concentrations will be plotted for each dose using a box-whisker plot by cycle and\nday within cycle in order to assess the attainment of steady-state.\n9.5.1.1. Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)\nIt is the responsibility of the Investigatorto have prospective approval of the study protocol,\nprotocol amendments,informed consent documents,and other relevant documents,\neg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1.

If QTc interval reverts to less than 501msec, and in\nthe judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsoris determined to be due to cause(s) other than\nstudy drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval\n>500msec or an increase of>60msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient\nwill be discontinued from the study.\nPrior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug,\nthorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in\npatient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and\npossible evaluation by specialist.\nIf a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures,\nor stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate\nECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.\nWhen matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK\ndraw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK\nsample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1hour post dose, then the\nECGs should be collected just prior to the 1hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be\ncollected at the nominal time).",

To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.

Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator.

In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe Investigatoris to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by\nthe study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.\n8.13. Reporting Requirements\nEach AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAEoccurs,\nexpedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAEoccurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24hours of Investigator awareness of the\nevent. In particular, if the SAEis fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be\nmade immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation. This timeframe\nalso applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAEreports\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nas well as to the initial and follow-up reportingof exposure during pregnancy, exposure via\nbreastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the Investigatordoes not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE\nimmediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the\nInvestigatoris to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time\nof his or her first awareness of the AE.\nFor all SAEs, the Investigatoris obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in\naccordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.\n8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse event reporting, including suspected unexpectedserious adverse reactions, will be\ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial\nwill be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.\nThis document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major\nmodifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also bereflected in a\nprotocol amendment.\n9.1.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4. Efficacy Analysis\n9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation\nIn the dose escalation portion of thestudy,anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response.\nIn addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be\nlisted.\nIf the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided\nby arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit\nresponse includes PR, CR and SD (≥24weeks from the first dose to treatment failure).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 115\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nIn the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective\nresponse rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be\ncalculated forexpansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical\nbenefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24weeks from first dose to treatment\nfailure).\nDOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any\ncause. In the event of no progression or death,the last tumor assessment date without\nprogression will be used in this calculation.\nPFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or\ndeath due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP.\nThe posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activitywill be\ncalculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients.\nTumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not\nlimited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition,\ndates of progression, death, first response,and last tumor assessment will be listed.\n9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.5.1. Analysis of Single-and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics\nPlasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ),\nmax\ntime to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration\nmax\nversus time curve (AUC , AUC ) forPF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib\nlast τ\nwill be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered\nappropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ),\ninf\nterminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V ,\n½ d\naccumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and\nac ss\nsteady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day.\nFor PF-05212384,docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinibconcentrations will be summarized\ndescriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation(CV), median, minimum,\nmaximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time.\nIndividual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose,\ncycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be\npresented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales.\nThe observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively.\nEach will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance\nwith a single term for dose.

Metabolite Profiling\nPlasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the\nclinical study report (CSR).\n9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate\nchanges in scores over time.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or\nan electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each includedpatient. The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to\nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory\nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nThe Investigatorhas ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical,\nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete,\nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The\nCRFs must be signed by the Investigatoror by an authorized staff member to attest that the\ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source\ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the\noriginal entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents arethe hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In\nthese cases datacollected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF,may also serve as source documents. In these\ncases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly\nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the\nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients(sufficient\ninformation to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed\nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and\ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant\ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be\nretained by the Investigatoraccording to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH),\nlocal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whicheveris\nlonger.\nIf the Investigatorbecomes unablefor any reason to continue to retain study records for the\nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation),Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The\nstudy records must be transferred to a designeeacceptable to Pfizer, such as another\nInvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.\nInvestigatorrecords must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or\ndiscontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe Investigatormust obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records,\neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12.

Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable\nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigatoris aware of any new\ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the\ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the Investigatorwill inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures\ntaken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of\nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigatorbecomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator. After notification, the Investigatormust contact all participating patientsand\nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all\nstudy materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDYRESULTS\n15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer\nPfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the\nresults of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trial\nDatabase (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with\napplicable local laws/regulations.\nIn all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and\ncomplete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in\nwhich the study was conducted.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 122\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\nPfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.govfor Pfizer-sponsored\ninterventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer\nproduct regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.

    "8.1. Adverse Events": "All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal\nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following\nsections.\nFor all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine\nthe outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a\nserious adverse event (SAE)requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated\nrepresentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigatorto\ndetermine the causality of the AE. The Investigatoris required to assess causality.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nFollow-up by the Investigatormay be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or\nstabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event\nthat is determined by the Sponsorto be serious will be reported by the Sponsoras a SAE. To\nassist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the\nInvestigatorto provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical\nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n• Abnormal test findings;\n• Clinicallysignificant symptoms and signs;\n• Changes in physical examination findings;\n• Hypersensitivity;\n• Drug abuse;\n• Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Drug overdose;\n• Drug withdrawal;\n• Drug misuse;\n• Drug interactions;\n• Extravasation;\n• Exposure during pregnancy(EDP);\n• Exposure via breastfeeding;\n• Medication error;\n• Occupational exposure;\n• Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported\nas AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by\nmeasurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be\nreported as AEs.\n8.4. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as\nan AEare as follows:\n• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or\n• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;\nand/or\n• Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose\nadjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant\ndrug treatment, or other therapy; and/or\n• Test result is considered to be an AEby the Investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not\nconstitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require\nreporting as an AE.\n8.5. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenceat any dose that:\n• Results in death;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of the\nability to conduct normal life functions);\n• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n• Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of\nprogression) should not be reported as anSAEunless the outcome is fatal within the\nsafety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease\nprogression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome\nduring the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death\nmust be recorded as an AEand as an SAEwith Common Toxicity Criteria for\nAdverse Events (CTCAE)Grade5 (see Section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important\nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events\nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the\ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see Section 8.13.1SAE Reporting Requirements).\n8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nLiver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this\nstudy. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because ofclinical\nsign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up\nas described below.\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria\noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered\nimportant medical events.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.6. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE. Examples include:\n• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the\ndevelopment of a new AE or witha worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for\nwork-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratoryabnormality);\n• Social admission (eg,patient has no place to sleep);\n• Administrative admission (eg,for yearlyphysical examination);\n• Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg,for a procedure required by the study\nprotocol);\n• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg, for elective\ncosmetic surgery);\n• Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. Theseshould be noted in the baseline\ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not\nbe reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed\nshould be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis\nthat begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting\nappendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.\n8.7. Severity Assessment\nGRADE Clinical Description of Severity\n0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the\nVersion 4.0 CTCAEdocument but may be used in certain circumstances.)\n1 MILD Adverse Event\n2 MODERATE Adverse Event\n3 SEVERE Adverse Event\n4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not\nnecessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the\npatient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the\ncriteria for SAEs listed above.\n8.8. Causality Assessment\nThe Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and\nnon-serious); the Investigatormust record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate,\nand report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements\nif applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.",
    "8.10. Occupational Exposure": "An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.",
    "8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section PatientWithdrawal)": "Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,\naccording to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on theappropriate AECRF\npage.\nWhena patient withdraws because ofanSAE, the SAEmust be reported in accordance with\nthe reporting requirements defined below.",

In addition, an Investigator\nmay be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an\nexpedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured\non the AECRF. In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.",
    "8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements": "All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE\nterm should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical\nterminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAEinformation.",

    "8.2. Reporting Period": "For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from\nthe time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s\nparticipation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or\nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last\nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsorif the\nInvestigatorbecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the\nInvestigatorbelieves have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational\nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has\ntaken at least one dose of investigational productthrough the patient’s last visit.\n• If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AEreporting period for non-serious\nAEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs\nduring the SAEreporting period after the last dose of investigational product,\nirrespective of any interveningtreatment.",
    "8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event": "An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a\nproduct or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the\ntreatment or usage.

An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or\nresult in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize\nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the\nimportant medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for\nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization;\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.",

    "8.6. Hospitalization": "Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or\nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation ofan existing admission. Admission also\nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric\nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a\ntuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization;\nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical\nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n• Rehabilitation facilities;\n• Hospice facilities;\n• Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n• Skilled nursing facilities;\n• Nursing homes;\n• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical\nAEis not in itself an SAE.

An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there\nexists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an\nAE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be\nprovided. If the Investigatordoes not know whether or not the investigational product\ncaused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for\nreporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor(see Section on Reporting Requirements). If\nthe Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational\nproduct”, this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the Investigatordetermines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the\nInvestigatormust record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as\nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAEreporting\nrequirements, if applicable.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016",
    "8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy": "For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during\npregnancy (EDP)occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been\nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational\nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or\nbeing exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure\nwould be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman\n(eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic\nproducts).\n2. Amale has been exposed (eg,because oftreatment or environmental exposure)to the\ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed\nduring his partner’s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the\nstudy patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this\ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form\nand Exposure in Utero(EIU)Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has\noccurred. In addition, the Investigatormust submit information regarding environmental\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant\nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIUForm.\nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24hours of\nawareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of\ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for\nall EIUreports with an unknown outcome. The Investigatorwill follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) andnotify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up\nto the initial EIUForm. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can\nbe assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) forthe\ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the\nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test\nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy,\nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a\nlive bornbaby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the\nInvestigatorshould follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n• Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard\nto causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1month should be reported as\nSAEs when the Investigatorassesses the infant death as related or possibly related to\nexposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancymay be requested by the\nInvestigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis\n(eg,follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal\nexposure, the Investigatorwill provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigatormust document in the source\ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to\nprovide to his partner.\n8.10. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person\n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the\nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24hours of the\nInvestigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an\nassociated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study,\nthe information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form\nis maintained in the investigator sitefile.\n8.11.

In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to\nallow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independentdetermination of\npossible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant\nmedications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a\nsummary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its\ndesignated representative.\n8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for\ncollection of SAEinformation is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are\ncollected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.

Statistical Methods and Properties\n9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B\nThe MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C\nFor Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\n9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2\nThe expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.\n9.3. Sample Size Determination\nOn April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy. For each arm, the primary\nobjective is to estimate the MTD.\nFor Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of\n21patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in\nArm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\nIt is expected that approximately 40patients will be needed, however, due to the number of\nDLTs this may vary.\nFor Arm C, there were2 componentsprior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first\ncomponent, patients participatedin a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD.\nThe study didnot proceed to the second component and a total of 33patients were enrolled.\nSample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC\nThe TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30response-evaluable patients,\nincluding 15 in Arm 1and 2,respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete\nresponse (CR)+partial response (PR)).\n• For 1st line patients (Arm 1):\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n60%response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9out of\n15patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true\nresponse is not inferior to 45%.\n• For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2)\n• Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of\nanti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a\n40%response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15patients) would have a\nposterior probability equal to91%that the true response is not inferior to 25%.\nThe total sample size for the study is approximately 124patients.\n9.4.

Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers\nForbiopsysamples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV,\nand minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical\nbiomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For\neach pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baselineof these same parameters will also be calculated.\nData from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive\nstatistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with\npharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumorefficacy. Graphics may be provided\nas appropriate.\n9.6. Safety Analysis\nSummaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis\nset.\n9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the\nstudy. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD\nas described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing\ncohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be\nlisted per dose level by arm.\n9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints\n9.6.2.1. Adverse Events\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigatoraccording to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03and coded using the\nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries,\nwhich will be by arm,will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial\nonset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and\npercentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE,\nand treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The\nsummaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle1\nand Cycles beyond1).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016\n9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities\nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be\nsummarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assayby arm. The\nanalyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle\n(Lead-in, Cycle1 and Cycles beyond1).\nFor laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal,\nabnormal or not done.\n9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments\nThe analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both\nbaseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate\nmeasurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data\nobtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be\naveraged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be\nincluded in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at\nunscheduled time points.\nQT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie,\nFredericia’s and possibly otherfactors). The adequacy of the correction method maybe\nassessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations\nmay be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR,\nQRS, andQTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be\nselected and used for the following analyses of central tendency andoutliers and used for the\nstudy conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum,\nand maximum) will be used to summarize the baselineQTc values and changes from\nbaseline in QTc byarm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum\nchange from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across\ntime-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change\nfrom baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc.\nShift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum\nCTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs\nbaseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval\nchanges from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses\nmay be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with\nPK/PD models.\n9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes\nThe number and percentage of patients who complete theEORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23\nwill be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures.\nThe mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95%CI) will be\ncalculated.

Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the\npurpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an\ninternal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and\nsummary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will includesurveillance\nfor SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.\nDiscussions between the Investigators and the SponsorregardingAEs and laboratory test\nabnormalitiesseen at each dose levelwill occurin an on-going manner at regular\nteleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and\ndetermineif furtherpatient enrollment is appropriate.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure\nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs)are being followed. The monitors may\nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The\nInvestigatorand institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditorsor its agents and appropriate\nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or\nto quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of\nPfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nIt is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the\nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the\nprocess.\n11.

DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is\ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the\nregulatory application (ie,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the\nMember State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by\na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal\nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries\nThe End of Trial in all participating countries is defined asthe Last Patient Last Visit\n(LPLV).\n14. SPONSORDISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authoritydecision,\nchange in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In\naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the\nInvestigator.

    "9.2. Statistical Methods and Properties": "",
    "9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B": "The MTD estimation in ArmsA and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose\nassignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian\nmethod with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity\nincreases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target\nDLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called\nequivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate inthe equivalence\ninterval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD\nestimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the\nuniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate.\nDose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate.\nSpecifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval,\nthe interval below it,and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for\neach of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method\nrecommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the\nequivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current doselevel; and it recommends a\nlower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval\nhas the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose\nlevels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if\nthe posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate,\nprovided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total\nnumber of patientstreated at the current doselevel is at least 5, then the criteria for\nrecommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT\nrate at the current doselevel: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be\nrecommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the\nfeasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment\nis similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment\nrecommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in\nFigure7.\nAt the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression.\nSpecifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic\nestimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which\nthe isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose\nlevels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTDestimate will be the highest\ndose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the\nlowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate.\nSimulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described\nand summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).\nIf 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT\nrate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level,\npending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 113\n)TMG(\n54:90\n1202-naJ-60\n:nO\ndevorppA\\devorppA\\e0b52f591e771090\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 11 November 2016",
    "9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C": "For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a\n3+3design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is\ndescribed in Section 3.1.1.\nTable17shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying\ntrue DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients,\nthere is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a\nDLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose\nescalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6patients experiencing DLTs.\nTable17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level\nTrue underlying DLT rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nProbability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001\nlevel\nIf the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including\nthose in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped\nfor the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators.",
    "9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2": "The expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D\nduring the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus\ncisplatin in patients with TNBC.\nEnrollment of patients to a specific armmay be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor\nactivity in that arm is observed during the study.",
    "9.3. Sample Size Determination": "On April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decidedto stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002\nclinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to\nenter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those\ncombinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design,\nassessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of\npatients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for\nArm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in\nprioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory\ninteractions.\nThere are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of thestudy.
